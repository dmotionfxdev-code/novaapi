"""Domain-level exception hierarchy.

Pure Python, zero HTTP awareness — every bounded context's domain and
application layers raise these; the interface layer (``api/middleware/
error_handling.py``) is the only place that knows how to turn one into an
HTTP response (Application Layer §2; API Resource Model §9).

No hazard-specific or context-specific subclasses live here — those belong
to each context's own domain layer once it exists. This module only defines
the shared vocabulary every context's errors are expressed in terms of.
